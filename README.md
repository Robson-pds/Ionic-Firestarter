# Ionic-Firestarter

Ionic Firestarter is a open source project showcasing different Firebase features implemented in Typescript via the Ionic framework.

At first it will show different ways to implement user authentication with Firebase. 
Going from there I hope to include support for Firestore and some fun examples of using this and realtime database.

Ensure you have both NodeJS, Ionic and cordova installed. Node can be gotten from the NodeJS website and is needed if you want to use npm.

I started this repo by writing some medium articles outlining how to setup the different providers with firebase.
